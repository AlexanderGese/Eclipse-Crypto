# Eclipse (ECL) - A Rust-Based Cryptocurrency (Proof of Concept)

## 🌌 Overview

Eclipse (**ECL**) is a Rust-based cryptocurrency designed as a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** to demonstrate the fundamental principles of blockchain technology and digital currency systems.  
> ⚠ **Note:** This project is non-functional and intended solely for educational purposes. It is not suitable for production or real-world use.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Blockchain Basics**: Implements a simple blockchain structure with blocks, transactions, and basic validation.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Demonstrates a lightweight PoW mechanism for mining blocks.
- **Rust-Powered Security**: Leverages Rust's memory safety and performance for efficient implementation.
- **Modular Design**: Organized structure to understand the roles of transactions, blocks, and miners.
- **CLI Simulation**: A basic Command-Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the blockchain.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run Eclipse (ECL) locally, ensure you have:
- Rust (stable) installed. Install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
- Basic knowledge of Rust programming and blockchain principles.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eclipse.git
cd eclipse
```

### Build the Project
```bash
cargo build
```

### Run the CLI
```bash
cargo run
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. Blockchain Structure
- **Blocks**: Contain a set of transactions, a timestamp, a nonce, and a hash of the previous block.
- **Transactions**: Represent simple transfers of "ECL" between pseudo-wallets.
- **Hashing**: Uses SHA-256 for block verification.

### 2. Proof of Work (PoW)
- Miners solve a computational puzzle by finding a valid nonce.
- The block is considered valid if its hash meets a predefined difficulty level.

### 3. CLI Commands
Interact with the blockchain using these commands:
- `add-transaction`: Add a mock transaction to the pool.
- `mine-block`: Mine the next block using the PoW mechanism.
- `view-chain`: View the current state of the blockchain.

## 🚀 Project Goals

Eclipse is **not** a fully functional cryptocurrency but a platform to learn about:
- Blockchain architecture.
- Rust's strengths in building secure and performant systems.
- Cryptographic techniques in digital currencies.

## 📝 Roadmap
While Eclipse is a PoC, future educational features could include:
- Advanced consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Stake).
- Wallet simulation with public/private keys.
- Networking to simulate a decentralized peer-to-peer system.
